# 🤖 Architectural Decision Record (ADR) - Index

> **Purpose:** This directory serves as a centralized log for all architectural and technical decisions made throughout the project. Each decision is tracked in its own file with context, alternatives considered, and consequences.
>
> **Why Keep It Here:** Maintaining the decision log inside the codebase (via Git) ensures it evolves alongside your code. It becomes a historical record that new developers and AI agents can reference to understand *why* certain design choices were made.

## Workflow

### 1. Propose & Draft
When a major design shift or technical challenge arises, create a new `DEC-00X.md` file using the template below. Set status to `Proposed`.

### 2. Discuss & Refine
Submit the decision in the same Pull Request (PR) as your proposed architecture changes. Use PR comments to discuss alternatives.

### 3. Accept & Merge
Once approved, change status to `Accepted` and merge the PR. The decision becomes a permanent historical marker.

### 4. Sync System Instructions
If the decision introduces a strict constraint, copy the relevant instruction into your `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, or linting configurations.

## Decision Template

Copy this template for each new decision (`DEC-00X.md`):

```markdown
# [DEC-00X]: [Decision Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** `Proposed` | `Accepted` | `Superseded by DEC-00X`  
**Author:** [Name/Team]  
**PR Reference:** [Link to PR]

## Context
[Describe the situation or problem that prompted this decision.]

## Decision
[State clearly what was decided.]

## Alternatives Considered
- **Option A:** [Description] — [Why rejected]
- **Option B:** [Description] — [Why rejected]
- **Option C:** [Description] — [Why rejected]

## Consequences
- **Positive:** [Expected benefits]
- **Negative:** [Potential drawbacks or trade-offs]

## Rule Sync (if applicable)
[If this decision introduces a strict constraint, note what system instructions should be updated.]

## Golden Rules of Maintenance

1. **Never delete** an accepted decision file if requirements change later.
2. **Always create a new decision** to document changes, and update the old decision's status to `Superseded by DEC-00X`.
3. **Keep it low-friction** — write decisions when changes happen, not after.
4. **Make it high-utility** — include concrete examples, error messages, and code references.
